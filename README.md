Creates an Ulam spiral of the specified size and starting point.  It knows
the first 10,000 primes which are hardcoded in primes.js.  The primes were copied from http://primos.mat.br/primeiros_10000_primos.txt

It's been a long long while since I did me some we dev, so this is a bit rough around the edges but it was a fun exercise.
